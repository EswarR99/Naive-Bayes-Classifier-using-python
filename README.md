PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Text classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier in python.


ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION:

Imported Naive Bayes Module from scikit-learn library.
The multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is suitable for classification with discrete features (e.g., word counts for text classification). The multinomial distribution normally requires integer feature counts. However, in practice, fractional counts such as tf-idf may also work.
